Notes about the implementation of the Sockets key:

relaunchd is different from the original Apple launchd in these regards:

* 	The Sockets key is a dictionary of dictionaries, period. This means
	that every socket must be assigned a name in the plist file.
	
*	When the job is launched, the socket descriptor number is passed
	as an environment variable named LAUNCHD_SOCKET_$FOO, where $FOO
	is the name that is defined in the plist.

* 	It is not necessary to "checkin" with launchd and call liblaunch
	functions to get socket information. The program can say something
	like this:
	
		if (getenv("LAUNCHD_SOCKET_MYSERVICE")) {
			fd = strtol(getenv("LAUNCHD_SOCKET_MYSERVICE"), &errorp, 10);
		}
